# "Mord im Hotel"

This projects target is to create a 3D multiplayer game inspired by games like desperados and commandos.
First milestone is to create a single level and make it an enjoyable experience.


# Gameplay
This game will be an asymmetric tactic game. 
There will be two teams:
- one attacking team which target is to assassinate a random chosen target
- one defending player who has to setup the level and to guide his A.I-driven units.

# Demo Setting

The setting of this first demo will be a hotel, where the attackers have to kill a random chosen politician or something like this.
